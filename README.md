This is a complete exercise named : Processing and Sorting Machine.
The exercise is from "PLC Programming - Structured Programming and Design Patterns" course on Udemy - Instructor is Marco Nucci.

This machine has 05 stations: Extraction, Lever, Elevator, Drilling, and Table.
1. Extraction station: the product is pushed to the lever station.
2. Lever station: lever gripper grabs the product to the elevator station.
3. Elevator station: the product is sent to the drilling station by an elevator.
4. Drilling station: a hole is drilled on the product, then an air actuation flows the drilled product to the table station.
5. Table station: a gripper grabs the drilled product, the table rorates, then the drilled product is dropped at a suitable position based on the color: red or blue.

There are 3 visualizations:
1. Visualization: displays the whole system
2. FaultVisu: displays the panel for force sensors and actuators
3. DiagnosticHMI: displays the first 5 faults

The simulation code is also prepared by Marco Nucci. This section stimulates the behavior of all devcies.

Program is created on CODESYS V3.5 SP21 Patch 1.
The project archive file is also included, in case the project file can't be opened properly.
